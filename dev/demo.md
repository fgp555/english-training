# Common Dialogues for Programmers (in English)

## 1. Talking about a bug:

> **Dev 1:** "Hey, did you see that the login page is crashing?"  
> **Dev 2:** "Yeah, I think itâ€™s because of a missing dependency. Let me check the console logs."

---

## 2. Reviewing a Pull Request:

> **Dev 1:** "Can you review my pull request when you have a minute?"  
> **Dev 2:** "Sure, I'll take a look after stand-up. Did you add tests for the new features?"

---

## 3. Planning a new feature:

> **Dev 1:** "We need to implement a search bar for the product list."  
> **Dev 2:** "Should it be client-side or server-side search?"  
> **Dev 1:** "Let's start with client-side and optimize later if needed."

---

## 4. Asking for help:

> **Dev 1:** "I'm stuck on this API integration. Mind giving me a hand?"  
> **Dev 2:** "Of course. Show me where you're getting the error."

---

## 5. During a Daily Stand-up:

> **Dev 1:** "Yesterday I finished setting up the authentication flow. Today I'll start working on the dashboard UI. No blockers."  
> **Dev 2:** "Cool. I'm still debugging the payment gateway integration."

---

## 6. Facing production issues:

> **Dev 1:** "The site is down! Who pushed to main?"  
> **Dev 2:** "I just merged the hotfix. Rolling back now!"
