# Daily Scrum Conversation - React.js Team (Remote, Casual)

---

### **Manager / Scrum Master:**  
> "Hey team, good morning! How’s everyone doing today?"

---

### **Developer 1 (Frontend - UI Components):**  
> "Good morning! Doing well, just had my coffee, so I’m ready to go!"  
> *(grins)*  
> "Yesterday, I finished up the responsive design for the profile page. Mostly some flexbox adjustments. Today, I’m planning to integrate the profile edit form with the backend API."  
> "I’m gonna use `react-hook-form` for validation, which should be a nice touch."  
> "The only thing is, I’m still waiting on the updated API endpoints from backend. So that’s a bit of a blocker right now."  
> **Manager:** "Ah, I’ll ping them for you again. Thanks for your patience!"  
> **Developer 2:** "Yeah, those backend guys can be elusive sometimes, huh?" *(laughs)*  
> **Developer 1:** "Right?! Hopefully they’ll get back to me soon."

---

### **Developer 2 (Frontend - State Management):**  
> "Morning! Yesterday, I refactored the product listing page to use Redux Toolkit instead of just prop drilling. Feels way cleaner now."  
> "Today, I’m adding optimistic updates to the cart actions. Want to make the cart feel super snappy when adding/removing items."  
> "No blockers at the moment. Everything’s going smoothly."  
> **Developer 1:** "Nice! That will definitely improve the user experience."  
> **Developer 3:** "Yeah, users won’t have to wait to see the cart update anymore. Love it!"  
> **Developer 2:** "Exactly! I can’t stand when I click something and it takes forever to update." *(laughs)*

---

### **Developer 3 (Frontend - Authentication):**  
> "Good morning, folks! Yesterday, I set up the protected routes with `react-router-dom` and got the basic auth context working."  
> "Today, I’m working on implementing token refresh, so the session doesn’t just expire on users unexpectedly."  
> "I’m still waiting for confirmation from the backend team on how the refresh token should be handled. I emailed them earlier, so fingers crossed I get a response soon."  
> **Developer 2:** "Oh, I know the feeling. Always waiting on them. You’ll get it soon!"  
> **Manager:** "I’ll check with them for you. Let’s make sure we’re all on the same page with that."  
> **Developer 3:** "Thanks! It’d be great to get that finalized."

---

### **Developer 4 (QA / Testing):**  
> "Hey everyone! Yesterday, I wrote some unit tests for the header and footer components. Got that done."  
> "Today, I’m diving into integration tests for the login flow. Hopefully, it all works as expected."  
> "The only thing is, I still don’t have access to the staging environment for end-to-end testing. Anyone know when that will be available?"  
> **Manager:** "Ah, I’ll follow up with IT right after this. You’ll have access soon."  
> **Developer 4:** "Perfect, thanks! I can’t wait to start testing the full flow."

---

### **Manager / Scrum Master:**  
> "Great work, team! Anything else we need to address today?"  
> **Developer 1:** "Nope, I think that covers everything on my end."  
> **Developer 2:** "All good here!"  
> **Developer 3:** "Same for me."  
> **Developer 4:** "All set as well. Just waiting on that staging access."  
> **Manager:** "Alright, I’ll take care of that. Keep me posted if anything else comes up. Let’s all crush it today!"  
> "Okay, team, have a great day. If anything urgent pops up, don’t hesitate to ping me in Slack!"  
> **Developer 1:** "Thanks, you too!"  
> **Developer 2:** "Take care, everyone!"  
> **Developer 3:** "Have a good one!"  
> **Developer 4:** "Catch you later!"  
> **Manager:** "Bye, team!"
