# Mini-Story Dialogues for Programmers

---

## 1. Debugging Nightmare

> **Dev 1:** "Why isn't the app fetching the data? It worked yesterday!"  
> **Dev 2:** "Did you change anything in the API?"  
> **Dev 1:** "Only added a new header... Wait, could that break it?"  
> **Dev 2:** "Let's check the network tab."  
> _(after checking)_  
> **Dev 2:** "Yep, 401 Unauthorized. Your token isn't being sent properly."  
> **Dev 1:** "Classic me. Thanks for spotting it!"

---

## 2. Code Review Drama

> **Dev 1:** "I left a few comments on your PR. Mainly about naming conventions."  
> **Dev 2:** "All good, I appreciate it. I was rushing a bit."  
> **Dev 1:** "No worries. Overall, solid work! Just fix those minor things and we can merge."  
> **Dev 2:** "Awesome. I'll update it right now."

---

## 3. Last-Minute Feature Request

> **Manager:** "Can we add multi-language support before the demo tomorrow?"  
> **Dev 1:** _(panicking)_ "Tomorrow?! That's a huge change!"  
> **Manager:** "Just something basic, maybe English and Spanish only."  
> **Dev 2:** "If we hardcode it for now and refactor later, it's doable."  
> **Dev 1:** "Alright... caffeine, don't fail me tonight."

---

## 4. Pair Programming Session

> **Dev 1:** "Let's solve this algorithm together. I think we're missing a base case."  
> **Dev 2:** "Right. Let's dry-run it with a small input."  
> _(They step through the function together.)_  
> **Dev 2:** "Ah, see? When the input is empty, it crashes."  
> **Dev 1:** "Perfect catch. I'll add a condition to handle that."

---

## 5. Deploy Gone Wrong

> **Dev 1:** "The deployment finished, but now users can't log in."  
> **Dev 2:** "Was there a database migration involved?"  
> **Dev 1:** "Uh... I think I forgot to apply it."  
> **Dev 2:** "Alright, let's run the migration scripts. Hope we don't have to roll back."
