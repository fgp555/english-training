there's a latin phrase pronounced amor fati
it's one of the more powerful ideas i've come across
its translation means love of fate

it implies everythings that happens is good or at the very least necessary and I think we need that remimder from time to time

because funny enough it is one of the first sentiments to leave us when we're in trouble when we're down or lost

the idea that everything has its value and sure we don't always understand it in the moment or when we're fighting through it

but that circumstance or even tragedy in the great play of life has a crufial role

someone recently sent me a beautiful clip from a Stephen Colbert interview, and I want to dive in

but there's a caveat I ask that you listen to this in a vacuum, for our purposes not going to be the Stephen Colbert who mocks half the country on live TV every night this is the wise Stephen Colbert with a lot of value to add because he can be both to frame the interview he's sitting across from Anderson Cooper.

and Anderson's asking him about something he said a while back, Anderson reads the quote "I've learned to love the things I'd most wished had not happened what punishments of god are not gifts".

Anderson then looks up from the paper looks over at Stephen and asks: do you really believe that

to which Stephen responds yes

it's a gift to exist and with existence comes suffering, there's no escaping that.
you can't pick and choose what to be grateful for. a truly incredible emotional moment it is the realization of amor fati

even the most trying of times are a brigge to something
even that which is taken away creates a space for one to untimately find what they need.
A couple years ago I did a keynote in hollywood beach talking about those difficult situations,

some of them are external, but some of them we create chaos self induced that opens the door to the most precious of occurrences things that I never would have had or arrived at if not for the pain the sadness the confusion.

it truly all fits together and so I basically take a trip down memory lane talking about the physical duress of a cold morning run.

wouldn't you know it strengthens one's conviction and belief in themself

or the sadness in leaving someone you care about someone you love.
knowing it's no longer what's best for either of you but what's necessary

touched on the fear the physical resistance i felt walking onto stages in 2015 and 16 dreaming of off ramps thinking of excuses in my head all the way up until the mic was in my hand on stage and words came out of my mounth

that propelled me to comfort and confidence in sharing my voice again

it's all one big puzzle every piece matters you don't get ups without downs

and as you push forward into the next thing and the next as you see the breadth of the unexpected and the power of the unknown you learn

you learn that the so called lows aren't the exception they're not a problem to be solved

and as I sit here now I even view them less as a cost than I once did a pain that must be endured

not it's all worthy and deserving of our gratitude it all matters it's all precious

I take about on a recent episode getting migraines and one of the days I remember more than any other in my life and I'm 36 now by the time this episode's released.

I have a few days under my belt, this one was truly memorable to me.
I was having a debilitating headache in a ton of pain finally able to fall asleep
and I remember waking up opening my eyes and realizing that the night had finally slipped by
morning arrived and I felt good again

I slowly got up kind of tilted my head back and forth testing the waters all clear I walked.

outside down to the beach and as the sun came up I sat on the lifeguard stand and just looked out in awe

outside down to the beach and as the sun came up I sat on the lifeguard stand and just looked out in awe

then sand the waves the seagulls the sky.
it all meant more in that moment than it ever had I was just beyond grateful to be here
and then so you talk about the lows being gifts, I get it
It sounds cliche at best maybe even ridiculous

but those lows I swear by it always seem to give me the things I'm most grateful for
it's a pattern that constantly repeats itself
the always remind me that the magic is the stuff I walk right by
the put me in hell for a period of time so that I understand to exist beyond that space is a miracle
without lows life's beauty becomes a baseline
and when something is a baseline it's definitionally average or regular it's mundane

I've learned to love all the things I'd most wished had not happened
what punishments of god are not gifts

it all matters it all brings you somewhere and if you're at a point where you're so deep in the weeds or so far in the trenches that you've forgotten

I hope this finds you and lifts you above it all
I hope it reminds you that you will arrive at the place you most need to be
and it will be not despite but because of this path you walked that you arrive there

some people live their entire lives waiting for miracles
and some people realize they're already in one and act accordingly
I hope today you choose the latter
