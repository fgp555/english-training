there's a latin phrase pronounced amor fati
it's one of the more powerful ideas i've come across
its translation means love of fate

it implies everythings that happens is good or at the very least necessary and I think we need that remimder from time to time

because funny enough it is one of the first sentiments to leave us when we're in trouble when we're down or lost

the idea that everything has its value and sure we don't always understand it in the moment or when we're fighting through it

but that circumstance or even tragedy in the great play of life has a crufial role

someone recently sent me a beautiful clip from a Stephen Colbert interview, and I want to dive in

but there's a caveat I ask that you listen to this in a vacuum, for our purposes not going to be the Stephen Colbert who mocks half the country on live TV every night this is the wise Stephen Colbert with a lot of value to add because he can be both to frame the interview he's sitting across from Anderson Cooper.

and Anderson's asking him about something he said a while back, Anderson reads the quote "I've learned to love the things I'd most wished had not happened what punishments of god are not gifts".

Anderson then looks up from the paper looks over at Stephen and asks: do you really believe that

to which Stephen responds yes

it's a gift to exist and with existence comes suffering, there's no escaping that.
you can't pick and choose what to be grateful for. a truly incredible emotional moment it is the realization of amor fati

even the most trying of times are a brigge to something
even that which is taken away creates a space for one to untimately find what they need.
A couple years ago I did a keynote in hollywood beach talking about those difficult situations,

some of them are external, but some of them we create chaos self induced that opens the door to the most precious of occurrences things that I never would have had or arrived at if not for the pain the sadness the confusion.

it truly all fits together and so I basically take a trip down memory lane talking about the physical duress of a cold morning run.

wouldn't you know it strengthens one's conviction and belief in themself

or the sadness in leaving someone you care about someone you love.
knowing it's no longer what's best for either of you but what's necessary

touched on the fear the physical resistance i felt walking onto stages in 2015 and 16 dreaming of off ramps thinking of excuses in my head all the way up until the mic was in my hand on stage and words came out of my mounth

that propelled me to comfort and confidence in sharing my voice again

it's all one big puzzle every piece matters you don't get ups without downs

and as you push forward into the next thing and the next as you see the breadth of the unexpected and the power of the unknown you learn

you learn that the so called lows aren't the exception they're not a problem to be solved

and as I sit here now I even view them less as a cost than I once did a pain that must be endured

not it's all worthy and deserving of our gratitude it all matters it's all precious

I take about on a recent episode getting migraines and one of the days I remember more than any other in my life and I'm 36 now by the time this episode's released.

I have a few days under my belt, this one was truly memorable to me.
I was having a debilitating headache in a ton of pain finally able to fall asleep
and I remember waking up opening my eyes and realizing that the night had finally slipped by
morning arrived and I felt good again

I slowly got up kind of tilted my head back and forth testing the waters all clear I walked.

outside down to the beach and as the sun came up I sat on the lifeguard stand and just looked out in awe

outside down to the beach and as the sun came up I sat on the lifeguard stand and just looked out in awe

then sand the waves the seagulls the sky.
it all meant more in that moment than it ever had I was just beyond grateful to be here
and then so you talk about the lows being gifts, I get it
It sounds cliche at best maybe even ridiculous

but those lows I swear by it always seem to give me the things I'm most grateful for
it's a pattern that constantly repeats itself
the always remind me that the magic is the stuff I walk right by
the put me in hell for a period of time so that I understand to exist beyond that space is a miracle
without lows life's beauty becomes a baseline
and when something is a baseline it's definitionally average or regular it's mundane

I've learned to love all the things I'd most wished had not happened
what punishments of god are not gifts

it all matters it all brings you somewhere and if you're at a point where you're so deep in the weeds or so far in the trenches that you've forgotten

I hope this finds you and lifts you above it all
I hope it reminds you that you will arrive at the place you most need to be
and it will be not despite but because of this path you walked that you arrive there

some people live their entire lives waiting for miracles
and some people realize they're already in one and act accordingly
I hope today you choose the latter because it is a gift to the here

simple truth: you don't need to get it right the first time you don't
you don't even need to be close you just can't do nothing
you need to convince your feet to start moving
you need to generate momentum for some type of outcome
because what that data what that outcome will tell you is yes keep doing more of that thing or no

reel it in and try something different
but either way progress is reliant upon that information
going equals solutions
staying equals hoping wishing lost opportunity

every journey is a long winding road it's comprised of wrong turns and dead ends
there will be main maintenance required issues to be resolved and narratives to be rewritten
none of which by the way is beyond you so long as you take these things as they arrive one by one

you open up your world to allow them in
and you might look at where you want to be
and think that's a lot right that's a world away
no, it's a few tiny decisions away repeated daily
there's a greek proverb that suggests beginnings is half the battle
why? well because convincing yourself you're capable, is not easy
trusting yourself completely hurts

but it's not until we come around and green light the progress
it's not until we give ourselves permission that life begins
how beautiful is the fact that we don't have to have all the answers not even close

we just need enough courage to step out into the storm to brave the wind and the rain I frequently alluded to this transformation the first time I spoke in front of an audience I was terrified

the first few times actually then after showing up getting reps in and reflecting I relalized okay I've earned a bit of confidence here
I continue to go to speak more reps more reps okay now we're well

I guess now we're getting comfortable with this I'm not up all night the night before rehearsing pacing in hotel rooms
a little more trust in my ability I continue more reps more reps more reps ok now

now I kind of enjoy this I've broken through more reps more reps more reps
now there's enough comfortability where I can look at what's in front of me and start asking
well now how do I refine this to stand out
how do I make this so valuable that it becomes the 1% of the 1% of the 1%
I've worked hard for my baseline I feel good
now how do I chisel away the little elements of mediocrity sprinkled in there

how do I pull them out one piece at a time
it is a testament to going to allowing yourself to experience life and data points and ups and downs all that help you refine the process

they are the journey, can you do all that overnight? no absolutely not
but you can always meet yourself where you are and win that battle
you can always become a little bit stronger setting the stage for the next level and the next and the next

in fact when you're in it it feels so intuitive that you don't even realize what you're doing one battle at a time you're just stepping on the stone in front of you

think about it you don't defeat a storm you simply navigate through each gust of wind and every drop of rain
you pick apart and outlast the pieces that make up the storm
and you are capable of that you're made for that again when you give yourself permission to enter the arena that is adversity that is the unknown

success is oddly intuitive it just kind of appears in front of you one obstacle at a time or one opportunity at a time depending on how you're looking at it

the problem is that too many of us stay on the sidelines
I think you know this right and when you wrap your mind around the fact that stagnation is the only adversary you become free

you unlock what yo could be and always should have been
I mean how brilliant the mind that incomprehensible network behind your eyes
capable of both putting a man into orbit and navigating the depths of the vast oceans that surround us

it is in and of itself a miracle but what if I was audacious enough to suggest temporarily taking that miracle
that masterpiece that network behind your eyes and shutting it off for a moment hitting pause on the defense mechanisms actively painting what ifs and worst case scenarios beggins you to play small and seemingly aways prioritizing safety over meaning

what if I made the case that the best thing you could possibly do is start now and ask questions later
begin the journey start the ride immerse yourself in the river's current and sure you don't know where you'll end up

but it won't be where you currently stand and that new you contains wisdom it contains that accrued data to improve upon it contains the 2.0

and so the key now and forever is not to expect all the answers before you step foot out the door
it's not to be sure everything will fall into place
it's simply to have the courage to move into the great unknown
without any reassurances it's you your belief in yourself and variable unknown

you don't have to get it right the first time, you just can't do nothing

so you have goals and aspirations beautiful you have hopes and dreams incredible
but what are you doing about it? because there's this equilibrium we have to create and maintain as we navigate our day-to-day lives

and no one addresses this in my mind better than Thoreau in Walden when he states if you've built your castles in the air, your work need not be lost, that's where they should be now put fundations under them

he addresses the very nature of creation of dreaming right he says you know there's an element of idealism and aspiration but you have to marry that with pragmatism

keep your head focused on the mountaintop, dream, aspire, imagine what life could be
but don't spend your day in thought, build the foundations put the foundations under that castle in the air by doing by stepping by every day
creating one more stair in the staircase that will bring that new reality into existence

over the years I've talked a lot about Steven Pressfield's book the war of art,
really the impact it's had on me I think for good reason you know personally i tend to gravitate away from structure right in fact unless I'm being deliberate
and cognizant of how I'm planning my day things can get messy pretty quickly so I have to really be intentional about that
and there were times in 2014 2015 2016 where you know I had visions of building something big and meaningful and making an impact on the world

and I'd sit down to build it whether it's white a speech create a video or episode
and that particular day I would feel like you know I just don't feel inspired
I wish I did, but hey can't force creativity right I'd close my laptop I'd get up and I'd move on
and it wasn't until I read pressfield's book that I understood
that's what every writer speaker creator builder deals with

It's on us to say no I'm setting this timer for 90 minutes I'm going to show up I'm going to pour my thoughts out
pour my heart and soul into this project and if something comes from it amazing if it doesn't that's ok

but over a long period of time that's how consistency is established that's the only way to create that necessary compounding that actually supports my goals and big picture and long term vision

that dedicated effort is an example of putting foundations under the castle in the air

I don't think we do this intentionally but there's often a misalignment between what we say we want and how we spend our time

and how we live our lives and just being honest it's challenging to see these inconsistencies in ourselves they sort of hide within our day to day lives
which is why that simple alignment exercise of asking what do I want
and is what I'm doing bringing that to life so critical

that's why Thoreau's question so deeply resonates
I'm saying this now and I'll say it forever the greatest changes in our lives will never be a product of some huge complex complicated series of movies
it won't be 4D chess calculus secret codes and strategies it's like no critical change starts with some simple adjustments
usually right at your feet right it's getting up earlier it's cutting something out adding a new activity for 20 minutes a day right these are the things that are life changing

doing the correct things simply and consistently
the old head in the clouds and feet on the ground attitude
dream like your life depends on it think as big as you can have your eyes fixated on mountaintops

just make sure that your feet are simultaneously moving that one step at a time you are going that way sometimes building those foundations requires more deliberate action added to the day-to-day sometimes it means cutting away the outliers and excesses of our day-to-day
it means fully immersing yourself in what remains

in Elon Musk's most recent biography by Isaacson.
a particular idea stood out to me and elon is a man who is literally seeking to invest in and create a world above the clouds
he said something and I'm paraphrasing like we need to free outselves from the in-case mindset
we have so much excess just in case we need it
and what happens is this dilutes one's capability
and impacts the mission or goal in fact he said if you're not removing so much that you essentially go oops and end up putting 10% of what you took out back in then you're not taking out enough

it creates clarity it allows you to best structurally support your vision
the mission to build above the clouds beyond what you currently know what currently exists

this is the same superpower of being deliberate that Thoreau champions that he advocates for just in a different context

it is the greatest dichotomy in human existence maintaining a vision while building the vision

having a dream while supporting that dream will look like is not enough similarly recklessly throwing brushstrokes against a canvas is not enough

these two things don't stand on their own so what if you today were able to effectively marry the two
what if you believed in yourself enough to create a vision and every single day chip away until you're staring directly at it

what if you got to know yourself at a deeper level truly understanding what mattered to you what you wanted to build most you looked in the mirror believed it and then committed to it's creation

step by step brick by brick moment by moment
if you have built castles in the air
your work need not be lost, that is where they should be

now put foundations under them
