It was an opportunity the entire time it was just disguised as a problem.
let me unpack this for you because this shift in thinking changes everything
so I want you to imagine the particular chapters or seasons of life

where what's in front of you feels so big that it's insurmountable
it's constant chaos fight or flight mode
it's the walls closing in around you right in those moments

historically you know I would feel disappointment 
and shame and just sadness right for letting that happen
it's like
how could I not have been better
how could I not have had the foresight
how am I the guy in this spot this

isn't good therefore I'm not good
you reap what you sow
but what I've come to learn is that not only is that thinking obviously counterproductive 
it's false

```
because it's in those very moments 
where it feels like the walls are caving in that we are handed the greatest opportunity of all
right we are not past decisions 
we're not prior circumstances we are defined by what we do amidst the chaos

we are defined by our ability to get back up and rise again
because those moments 
yeah the very moments that feel like you're suffocating they are when life begins
but go beyond the semantics 
here because I'm not speaking metaphorically I'm not trying to be cute with words

truly when we feel lost and overwhelmed and stuck and scared
when we feel the odds are stacked against us
when every door seems locked
that's when the universe presses the play button and the movie starts
