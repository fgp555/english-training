[STOP MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT SURROUNDS YOU - Best Morning Motivational Video Speeches](https://youtu.be/buXv7wHS3Kk)

```

It was an opportunity the entire time it was just disguised as a problem.
let me unpack this for you because this shift in thinking changes everything
so I want you to imagine the particular chapters or seasons of life

where what's in front of you feels so big that it's insurmountable
it's constant chaos fight or flight mode
it's the walls closing in around you right in those moments

historically you know I would feel disappointment
and shame and just sadness right for letting that happen
it's like
how could I not have been better
how could I not have had the foresight
how am I the guy in this spot this

isn't good therefore I'm not good
you reap what you sow
but what I've come to learn is that not only is that thinking obviously counterproductive
it's false

```
because it's in those very moments
where it feels like the walls are caving in that we are handed the greatest opportunity of all
right we are not past decisions
we're not prior circumstances we are defined by what we do amidst the chaos

we are defined by our ability to get back up and rise again
because those moments
yeah the very moments that feel like you're suffocating they are when life begins
but go beyond the semantics
here because I'm not speaking metaphorically I'm not trying to be cute with words

truly when we feel lost and overwhelmed and stuck and scared
when we feel the odds are stacked against us
when every door seems locked
that's when the universe presses the play button and the movie starts
```

```
and yeah, no one avoids these moments
there's a difficulty a suffering attached to living.
that's the human predicament.
but some of us a few of us accept the invitation
to turn those moments and that suffering into something beautiful.

Y sí, nadie evita estos momentos.
Hay una dificultad, un sufrimiento ligado al hecho de vivir.
Esa es la condición humana.
Pero algunos de nosotros, unos pocos, aceptamos la invitación
de transformar esos momentos y ese sufrimiento en algo hermoso.

a select few take the ticket and step into a world of their making
It's crazy how context changes our perspective
right it's like you really thought  life was getting up and meditating
and going into your little cold plunge when things are good
when the toughest decision you had to make that day
was whether or not to get starbucks
brother that's not life that's cruise control

Unos pocos seleccionados toman el boleto y entran en un mundo creado por ellos mismos.
Es una locura cómo el contexto cambia nuestra perspectiva.
Exacto, es como si realmente pensaras que la vida se trata de levantarse, meditar
y meterse en tu pequeño baño de agua fría cuando todo va bien,
cuando la decisión más difícil que tenías que tomar ese día
era si ibas o no a comprar un café en Starbucks.
Hermano, eso no es la vida, eso es el piloto automático.
